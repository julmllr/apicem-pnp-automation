# apicem-pnp-automation

This repository holds the python code used for the Cisco Live Plug and Play lab. 
The script is automating the onboarding process of new network devices with the Cisco APIC-EM server. New devices can be added through batch processing using a csv input file containing all the required data. A sample file following the required naming conventions is part of the repository. There is also the option to automatically generate device configuration files based on templates.
